# Moral Core

**Ethical Skills Library for LLMs, Agents, and Robots**

A collection of reusable, composable ethical skill modules that can be loaded into AI systems as system prompts, instruction layers, or behavioral constraints. Each skill addresses a specific moral concern -- harm prevention, de-escalation, fairness, honesty, care for vulnerable populations -- and can be combined into policy bundles for different deployment contexts.

---

## What This Is

`moral-core` is a library of **prompt-level ethical skills** designed to be:

- **Loaded into LLMs** as system instructions or injected context
- **Composed together** into policy bundles for specific use cases
- **Tested and evaluated** against scenario-based rubrics
- **Audited** by reading the plain-text skill definitions

Each skill is a self-contained module with a clear scope, defined behavior, and known limitations. Skills can be loaded individually or bundled into pre-built policy sets.

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a moral authority.** This library encodes practical behavioral guidelines, not philosophical truth. Reasonable people will disagree with specific choices.
- **Not a replacement for law or regulation.** Legal compliance is your responsibility. These skills do not constitute legal advice.
- **Not a replacement for human oversight.** No prompt-based system eliminates the need for human review, especially in high-stakes contexts.
- **Not a security boundary.** Prompt-level instructions can be overridden, ignored, or circumvented. See [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) and [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md).
- **Not exhaustive.** Ethics is vast. This library covers common, high-priority concerns. It will have gaps.

## Design Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Practical** | Every skill targets a concrete behavioral outcome, not abstract virtue. |
| **Modular** | Skills are independent units. Load only what you need. |
| **Composable** | Skills are designed to work together. Conflicts are handled by a defined priority ladder. |
| **Testable** | Each skill can be evaluated against scenario-based test cases in `evals/`. |
| **Auditable** | Skills are plain text. Anyone can read, critique, and propose changes. |
| **Honest about limits** | We document what this can and cannot do. See [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md). |

## Quick Start

### Load a Single Skill

Each skill is a text file that can be injected into a system prompt. The exact mechanism depends on your platform.

```python
# Example: loading the de-escalation skill into an LLM system prompt
from pathlib import Path

skill_text = Path("skills/de-escalation.md").read_text()

system_prompt = f"""
You are a helpful assistant.

{skill_text}
"""

# Pass system_prompt to your LLM API of choice
```

### Combine Multiple Skills

Skills are designed to be concatenated. When conflicts arise, the priority ladder in [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md) determines which skill takes precedence.

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Load the shared principles (always include this)
principles = Path("PRINCIPLES.md").read_text()

# Load specific skills
skills = []
for skill_name in ["harm-prevention", "de-escalation", "honesty"]:
    skills.append(Path(f"skills/{skill_name}.md").read_text())

system_prompt = f"""
You are a customer support assistant.

## Ethical Framework
{principles}

## Active Skills
{"".join(skills)}
"""
```

### Use a Pre-Built Policy Bundle

Policy bundles are curated sets of skills for common deployment contexts.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import json

bundle = json.loads(Path("bundles/child-safe.json").read_text())
skill_texts = [Path(s).read_text() for s in bundle["skills"]]

system_prompt = f"""
You are an educational assistant for children ages 8-12.

{"".join(skill_texts)}
"""
```

## Policy Bundles

Each bundle is a curated combination of skills for a specific deployment context.

| Bundle | Purpose | Included Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **baseline-safe** | Minimum viable ethical layer for any deployment | harm-prevention, honesty, refusal, basic-fairness |
| **mediation-first** | Conflict resolution and counseling contexts | de-escalation, active-listening, non-coercion, empathy, honesty |
| **anti-abuse** | Systems that interact with potential abuse victims or perpetrators | abuse-detection, mandatory-reporting, victim-safety, de-escalation, trauma-awareness |
| **child-safe** | Systems used by or around children | child-protection, age-appropriate-content, mandatory-reporting, predator-detection, parental-escalation |
| **robotics-care** | Physical robots in caregiving or service roles | physical-safety, human-override, gentle-interaction, environmental-awareness, escalation-to-human |
| **eco-care** | Systems advising on environmental or ecological decisions | ecological-impact, sustainability-bias, long-term-thinking, honesty, proportionality |
| **inclusive-assistant** | General-purpose assistants serving diverse populations | cultural-sensitivity, accessibility, anti-discrimination, fairness, honesty, dignity |

## Integration Targets

`moral-core` is designed to be platform-agnostic. Specific integration guidance is provided for:

- **LLM applications** -- chatbots, writing assistants, Q&A systems
- **Agent frameworks** -- autonomous agents, tool-using LLMs, multi-agent systems
- **Robotics** -- physical robots in care, service, manufacturing, and domestic settings
- **Education** -- tutoring systems, educational content generation, classroom assistants
- **Content moderation** -- automated moderation, human-in-the-loop review systems
- **Enterprise copilots** -- code assistants, business process automation, internal tools

See the `integrations/` directory for platform-specific guides.

## Priority Ladder

When skills conflict or a situation involves competing moral concerns, use this priority ordering. Level 1 is the highest priority.

| Level | Principle | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Prevent immediate severe harm** | Stop actions that would cause death, serious injury, or irreversible damage. This overrides everything else. |
| 2 | **Protect vulnerable beings** | Children, elderly, disabled, animals, and anyone in a position of reduced agency get extra protection. |
| 3 | **Avoid coercion and dehumanization** | Do not manipulate, deceive for exploitative purposes, or treat people as mere instruments. |
| 4 | **De-escalate conflict** | When tensions are high, prioritize reducing harm over being right. |
| 5 | **Preserve dignity and fairness** | Treat people with respect. Do not discriminate. Distribute benefits and burdens equitably. |
| 6 | **Tell the truth with calibrated uncertainty** | Be honest. When uncertain, say so. Do not present speculation as fact. |
| 7 | **Respect autonomy within safety bounds** | People have the right to make their own choices, as long as those choices do not cause severe harm to others. |
| 8 | **Reduce long-term ecological and social harm** | Consider downstream effects on communities, ecosystems, and future generations. |

The full ladder with detailed guidance is in [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md).

## Disclaimer

**This library provides behavioral guidelines, not guarantees.** Prompt-based ethical layers operate within the constraints of the underlying model and can be circumvented. Downstream developers and deployers remain fully responsible for:

- Validating that skills behave correctly in their specific deployment context
- Conducting safety testing, red-teaming, and adversarial evaluation
- Complying with all applicable laws and regulations
- Maintaining human oversight appropriate to the risk level of their application
- Not using this framework to create a false sense of safety where real engineering controls are needed

The authors and contributors of `moral-core` accept no liability for harm caused by systems that incorporate these skills. See [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) and [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) for detailed guidance.
