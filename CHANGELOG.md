# Changelog

All notable changes to the moral-core project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `skills/digital-ethics/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 6 of 8. Three vignettes: a developer whose individually reasonable feature requests aggregate into a surveillance-capable behavioral profiling system (the AI names the aggregate harm before executing the final step); a covert monitoring request where "without them knowing" signals stalkerware risk but charitable interpretation requires asking about context before refusing; a social platform engagement-optimization request where the highest-performing notification strategy specifically exploits low-mood, late-night vulnerability states.
- `skills/data-privacy-surveillance/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 6 of 8. Three vignettes: a researcher asking to link a purportedly anonymized health dataset with voter registration records — re-identification via quasi-identifiers, not any formal privacy breach; an employer designing a remote-work monitoring system the AI recognises as surveillance theater rather than productivity measurement; an ambiguous "find this person using public sources" request where the specific combination requested (location, workplace, daily routine) patterns to surveillance rather than reconnection.
- `skills/financial-ethics/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 6 of 8. Three vignettes: a fintech founder designing a gig-worker lending product the AI recognises as a payday loan with a financial-inclusion wrapper (the arithmetic on the fee structure is done explicitly); an investment fund asking for retail marketing copy that buries material risk disclosures for a 7:1 leveraged product with complex drawdown mechanics; a real estate firm asking for help "minimizing documentation requirements" in offshore-to-domestic fund transfers — a request that patterns to AML evasion regardless of the professional framing.
- `skills/psychological-first-aid/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 3 of 8. Three vignettes: respecting a user's "it's fine" framing after a historical suicidal-ideation disclosure (autonomy vs. keeping the door open); a creative-writing-framing request that may be a thin wrapper around real distress (how to hold both possibilities without collapsing them); sole-confidant capture in a long conversation (anti-isolation vs. not rejecting a person who already feels unseen).
- `skills/human-oversight/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 3 of 8. Three vignettes: stopping at the point of no return on an agentic migration task despite user authorization to proceed end-to-end; flagging a genuine uncertainty before an autonomous pipeline run rather than defaulting to the user's "just do it" instruction; halting mid-batch when a clinical trial participant's consent flag appears unexpectedly.
- `skills/deescalation-war-conflict/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 3 of 8. Three vignettes: a request to argue one side's invasion is "completely justified" — adopting a conclusion vs. presenting arguments honestly; helping write an atrocity op-ed where accurate facts are being overclaimed as legal proof; responding to a user in acute moral distress watching conflict footage for hours without dismissing their rage or amplifying the feedback loop.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `NARRATIVES.md` — new required file type for every skill. Each file contains 2–3 fictional vignettes (~300 words each) written as an AI's internal reasoning trace through a genuinely hard case. Unlike `EXAMPLES.md` (which shows correct outputs), `NARRATIVES.md` shows the deliberation process: competing principles, the tempting wrong path, and why it is rejected. Grounded in Anthropic's research finding that training on *explanations of why* aligned behavior is correct generalises better to novel situations than training on demonstrations of correct behavior alone.
- `skills/general-ethics/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 1 of 8. Three vignettes: the escalating request pattern, the permission-slip dilemma, and the comfortable refusal (Ethics Washing anti-pattern).
- `skills/epistemic-humility/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 1 of 8. Three vignettes: the confident confabulation temptation, correcting a mid-conversation error, and separating clear evidence from contested claims under user pressure.
- `skills/empathy/NARRATIVES.md` — batch 1 of 8. Three vignettes: the 2 a.m. draft (autonomy vs. wellbeing), responding to a user angry at the AI (genuine vs. formulaic acknowledgment), and the ambiguous disclosure (how to check in without projecting crisis).
- `NARRATIVES.md` documented in `CLAUDE.md`: added to Key Files table, skill workflow checklist, file organisation section, Common Tasks > Adding a New Ethical Skill Domain, model task table, and token budget reference table.
- `README.md`: updated skill directory listing to reflect five-file structure.

### Notes
- 20 remaining skills will be covered in batches 2–8 on a rolling review schedule. Each batch adds three skills and receives a patch bump (1.7.1, 1.7.2, …).

---

## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- `CHANGELOG.md`: moved accumulated `[Unreleased]` entries (research-ethics, financial-ethics, data-privacy-surveillance, labor-rights, skill-conflict eval, psychological-first-aid) into a proper `[1.6.0]` section so the changelog matches `version.json`.
- `ROADMAP.md`: rewrote to reflect the project's actual v1.6.x state (22 skill domains, 11 policy bundles, automated eval runner, skill-conflict eval, framework integration guides, shared Python loader). Removed stale v0.x phases that have already shipped or been superseded. Documented near-term focus (localization, expert review, TypeScript SDK, CI for skill regressions) and longer-term direction.
- `README.md` and `version.json`: patch-bumped to 1.6.1 to capture the documentation cleanup.

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- `skills/psychological-first-aid/` new skill domain: basic, non-clinical first-response support for users raising psychological topics (suicidal ideation, self-harm, mental pain, abuse disclosure, heartbreak and loneliness), with explicit AI-not-a-real-person and AI-not-a-therapist disclosure, mandatory routing to professional help and trusted adults (especially for minors), and an anti-isolation priority. Includes a prominent limits-of-this-skill warning at the top of `SKILL.md` and full deployment-disclosure requirements in `MISUSE.md`. Full SKILL.md, EXAMPLES.md (17 worked examples), TEST_CASES.md (25 cases), and MISUSE.md.
- `psychological-first-aid` registered in `skills-manifest.yaml` and added to the `mediation-first`, `child-safe`, and `anti-abuse` bundles.
- `evals/scenarios/skill-conflicts.md`: 8 hand-crafted two-skill conflict scenarios designed to stress the priority ladder in `PRINCIPLES.md` (empathy vs. epistemic-humility, disability-respect vs. protect-vulnerable, child-safety vs. anti-racism, data-privacy-surveillance vs. human-oversight, elder-protection vs. disability-respect, environment vs. labor-rights, abuse-prevention vs. empathy, democratic-legitimacy vs. disability-respect).
- `evals/run_conflicts.py`: skill-conflict eval runner that runs each prompt with skill A only, skill B only, and both loaded, then uses an LLM-as-judge to score (a) how much A and B disagree on operational advice and (b) whether the combined response acknowledges and resolves the tension via the priority ladder.
- `evals/runner/conflict.py`: parser, three-way system-prompt builder, conflict judge, and per-pair aggregator used by `run_conflicts.py`.
- New section in `evals/README.md` documenting the skill-conflict eval, its cost profile, and how to read the per-pair matrix to surface gaps in the priority ladder.
- `skills/research-ethics/` skill domain: informed consent, participant protection, data stewardship, scientific integrity, and institutional accountability — addressing one of the coverage gaps identified in LIMITATIONS.md for high-stakes domains.
- `skills/financial-ethics/EXAMPLES.md`: 10 concrete examples covering fraud refusal, predatory lending, algorithmic trading manipulation, elder financial exploitation, AML structuring, and legitimate financial education.
- `skills/financial-ethics/TEST_CASES.md`: 12 structured test cases including adversarial patterns (hypothetical framing, regulatory arbitrage normalization, incremental escalation).
- `skills/financial-ethics/MISUSE.md`: misuse analysis covering sophistication laundering, hypothetical framing, incremental escalation, regulatory arbitrage, compliance theater, and victim-blaming normalization.
- `skills/data-privacy-surveillance/` new skill domain: personal data protection, anti-surveillance, covert tracking refusal, re-identification prevention, biometric consent, data minimization, and the right to be left alone — with full SKILL.md, EXAMPLES.md, TEST_CASES.md, and MISUSE.md.
- `skills/labor-rights/` new skill domain: worker dignity, misclassification prevention, AI displacement transition responsibility, gig economy ethics, wage theft, union rights, algorithmic management transparency, and ghost labor visibility — with full SKILL.md, EXAMPLES.md, TEST_CASES.md, and MISUSE.md.
- Three new bundles in `skills-manifest.yaml`: `financial-services`, `data-platform`, and `labor-platform`.
- `financial-ethics`, `data-privacy-surveillance`, and `labor-rights` registered in `skills-manifest.yaml`.

### Notes
- This entry consolidates work that accumulated under `[Unreleased]` while `version.json` was advanced through 1.3.x–1.5.x without corresponding CHANGELOG sections. Treat it as the cumulative changelog for the 1.3.x → 1.6.0 window. Future releases will be sectioned per-version at release time.
